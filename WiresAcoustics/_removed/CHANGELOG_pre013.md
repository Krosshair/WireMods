## 0.1.2
- Added: sound reaching you by bouncing. Room rays bounce a second time off what they hit (angle in = angle out), and sounds behind walls also try the shortest bounce paths: down a corridor and round its far corner, round two corners.
- Added: echo. Out in the open, a big hard surface facing you 15 to 50 m away (a cliff, a hillside, a wall) sends sounds back from its direction, delayed by its real distance.
- Added: rain and wind indoors come from the opening's real direction with the HRTF on (behind and above as well as left and right), keeping their stereo.
- Added: the air dulls distant sounds' highs (a fight 60 m away is duller, not just quieter).
- Changed: no more pitch drop for distant sounds in the Mistlands mist (fog doesn't change pitch); they keep their reverb there too.
- Added: Wire's Stackify support. Its chest sounds after a quick stack or restock come from each chest, as world sounds.
- Changed: sounds that used to cut off at their max distance now reach twice as far and fade out there, instead of fading inside their range (a hit 30 m away is heard again).
- Optimized: the list of sounds tracked for direction and distance changes in place instead of being rebuilt; locations and dungeons get their sound filters and lose their reverb zones as they're placed, instead of scene-wide searches every few seconds.
- Changed: the HRTF's outer-ear dip is narrower and only for sounds well above or below you, so equipment and other sounds near your character aren't dulled.
